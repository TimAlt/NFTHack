# NFTHack

The plan was to create a simple game where players could earn components for spaceships and combine them to form NFTs. The plan was to use the Moralis Unity SDK to interact with the blockchain (would have tried Polygon, but I never got that far).

### What I got done during the hackathon

* I created models in Blender and split them into smaller components. There are two player ships with three parts each that can be mixed and matched.
* There is a basic gameloop where players can move and shoot at enemies.

### What I attempted during the hackathon

* Integrating the Moralis Unity SDK. As of v1.0.2, the Examples folder is very important, but gave me bugs before I could attempt to connect to any wallet. Deleting the folder creates endless bugs.

### Didn't start

* Allowing users to earn components and merge them. Would have been cool to automatically take screenshots of user's custom ships and upload them to IPFS for metadata.
